## Introduction to Snowflake
Snowflake is a powerful data warehousing solution that enables users to store, manage, and analyze large volumes of data in a scalable and efficient manner. It supports various data formats and provides features for data sharing, security, and performance optimization.

## Getting Started with SnowSQL
SnowSQL is the command-line interface for interacting with Snowflake. To get started:
1. **Install SnowSQL**: Follow the installation guide on the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql.html#installing-snowsql).
2. **Configure Your Connection**: Set up your SnowSQL configuration file to connect to your Snowflake account.

## Common Commands
Here are some commonly used SnowSQL commands:
- `snowsql -c <connection_name>`: Connect to a Snowflake account.
- `SELECT * FROM <table_name>;`: Query data from a table.
- `PUT file://<file_path> @<stage_name>;`: Upload a file to a Snowflake stage.

## Examples
### Example 1: Querying Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE region = 'North America';
