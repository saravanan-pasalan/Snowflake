## Step 3: Verify the Loaded File

Verify that the file is loaded into the stage using the list command.

## Step 4: Create a File Format

Create a file format for the JSON data.

## Step 5: Create a Snowflake Table

Create a Snowflake table to load the JSON data.

## Step 6: Load Data into the Snowflake Table

Load the data from the stage into the Snowflake table.

## Querying the Data from the Snowflake Table

Query the data from the Snowflake table.

## Querying the Data from the Stage Without Loading

Query the JSON data directly from the stage without loading it into a table.

## Validating the JSON File

Validate the JSON file after loading into a table and before processing.

## Extracting Values from JSON

Extract values from the JSON file into a table format.

## Conclusion

Follow these steps to successfully load, query, and validate JSON data in Snowflake.
